### Changing the Word List

Open `word_search_game.py` and modify the `WORDS_TO_FIND` list near the top of the file:

```python
# Word List (Theme: Space Exploration)
WORDS_TO_FIND = [
    "YOUR", "CUSTOM", "WORDS", "GO", "HERE"
]
```

### Changing the Theme

All colors and fonts are defined as constants at the top of `word_search_game.py`. Feel free to change these values to create your own unique theme.

```python
# Colors (Creative Theme: "Cosmic Neon")
COLOR_BACKGROUND = (5, 10, 20)      # Deep space blue
COLOR_GRID_LINES = (40, 60, 80)     # Faint nebula lines
COLOR_LETTER = (200, 220, 255)      # Bright star white
# ... and so on
```
